# Accretion-efficiency
The required code for Accretion efficiency for high redshift central SMBHs in quasars using the QUOTAS and QuasarNET dataset. The flux and volume limited (corrected) data were imported using the [Flux and Volume limited](https://github.com/artakh10/Flux-and-Volume-limit) code with a bin width of 2.5.
